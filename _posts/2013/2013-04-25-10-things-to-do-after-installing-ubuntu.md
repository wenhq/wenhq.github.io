[10 Things to Do After Installing Ubuntu
13.04](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/d0od/~3/8Uxr1TRMVF8/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-13-04):


**Ahead of its release later today we thought we’d share with you our
list of 10 things to do after installing Ubuntu.**

These range from the obvious (but often forgotten) to the obscure (but
super handy). Each entry aims to help all users, newcomer and
seasoned-pro alike, get the most from Ubuntu.

### 1. See What’s Changed

Whether Ubuntu 13.04 is your first taste or you’re coming back for more,
it helps to know what has changed on the desktop.
And while Ubuntu 13.04 isn’t as heavy on new features as previous
releases have made us accustomed to, it does adds some much needed
finesse and polish to the desktop experience.
To get you up to speed we’ve compiled a selection of the [key features
available in Ubuntu
13.04](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/new-ubuntu-13-04-features "10 Best Ubuntu 13.04 Features – From Social Lens to Window Snapping")
into a bouncy little video….


### 2. Enable Additional Drivers

[![drivers](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/drivers.jpg)](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/drivers.jpg)
Ubuntu works well with most modern hardware out of the box, but you may
want to enable third-party drivers to get the best performance.
This is a must if you’re looking to **play games from Steam**; **watch
high-definition video**; or just generally **want a more peppy-feeling
and responsive desktop**.
Some **WiFi Cards also require ‘proprietary’ drivers** to
function properly.
But you don’t need to take to the web to hunt down drivers. Just
open the *Software Sources *app via the Dash (or through *System
Settings*) and click the *‘Additional Drivers*‘ tab to see what’s
available for your device.

### 3. Enable Music & Video Playback

[![music](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/music.jpg)](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/music.jpg)
For legal reasons **Ubuntu isn’t able to play certain music and film
formats by default**.
The good news is that installing what’s needed to enable this is a just
a click or so away.
If you’re reading this *before* installing Ubuntu then check
the* ’Enable Restricted Formats’* box during initial set-up.
If you’re reading *after* install, no worries – just**hit the button
below to install** the most commonly used audio and video codecs.

Codecs ](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/ubuntu-restricted-extras/ "Multimedia codecs for Ubuntu") 

### 4. Add & Manage Your Online Accounts

[![account-toggles](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/account-toggles.jpg)](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/account-toggles.jpg)
Ubuntu comes with a centralised hub for your online accounts. Rather
than having to manually enter log-in details for every app, you just add
it once to ‘Online Accounts’ so other applications can use the data
securely.
A new feature in Ubuntu 13.04 lets you **choose which applications can
use which online account. **Don’t want Empathy to login to Facebook
Chat? Switch it off. Fed up of your Google Docs in the Dash? Disable
it.
Services supported include Twitter, Google, Yahoo!, Facebook (including
Facebook Chat), Flickr, and many more.
Apps that ‘hook in’ to *Online Accounts* include Ubuntu’s instant
messaging app *Empathy;* the new*Social lens*; and photo manager
*Shotwell.*

### 5. Install Your Favourite Apps

[![apps](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/apps.jpg)](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/apps.jpg)
Ubuntu comes pre-installed with a wide selection of software – including
a fully-featured office suite, music and video apps, web-browser, etc.
But one-size doesn’t fit all; there may be another app you prefer using
or need. Just open the Ubuntu Software Center to browse and install
thousands of free applications, including popular choices like:

-   **Chromium** - Open-source version of Google Chrome web-browser
-   **GIMP** – Free Photoshop alternative
-   **Skype** – Instant Messaging & Video Chat App
-   **Hotot** – Desktop twitter app
-   **VLC** – Popular media player

### 6. Adjust Your Privacy Settings

[![privacy](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/privacy1.jpg)](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/privacy1.jpg)
To speed up your workflow the *Unity Dash* offers you an overview of
your recent application and file activity. Handy, for sure, but there
might be files, folders or activities that you don’t want tracked.
Along with an “Off” switch, the *Privacy* options available in
the *System Settings* lets you choose what content is logged and what
isn’t. Further more it offers up buttons to ‘clear’ data from given
periods.



### 7. Blur The Lines Between Web & Desktop

[![gmails](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gmails.jpg)](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gmails.jpg)
A lot of people forget that Ubuntu comes with an innovative web-app
integration feature. Over [30 popular websites – including Gmail,
YouTube & BBC News – are
supported](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/07/list-of-that-websites-support-unitys-new-web-apps-feature "List of Websites That Support Unity Web Apps").
For example, add *GMail* and you get fancy Gmail options in the Launcher
and Messaging Menu; enable *BBC New*s and you’ll get notification alerts
on new headlines, and so on. 

### 8. Axe Amazon Suggestions

Ubuntu’s[new ‘Smart Scopes’ service wasn’t ready in time for Ubuntu
13.04,](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/03/smart-scopes-not-mature-enough-to-ship-in-ubuntu-13-04 "Smart Scopes ‘Not Mature Enough’ to Ship in Ubuntu 13.04")
so the Dash isn’t as clever as it should be. Meaning that, yes, Amazon
product suggestions will appear in the Dash for whatever you search.
The good news is that feature can be switched off with a click, so
there’s no need to avoid using Ubuntu altogether.
Open the *Privacy* pane of *System Settings* and set the *‘Include
Online Search Results’* toggle to *‘Off’.*

[![privacy](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/privacy.jpg)](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/privacy.jpg)

Be aware that switching this ‘off’ will **also affect other lenses**
that require an internet connection – including the Music lens and
Social lens.

Our tip? If you want to keep everything else working, but don’t want
Amazon result, just open the *Ubuntu Software Center*, search for
‘*shopping lens’* to find it, then hit the *‘remove’* button to
uninstall it permanently.

### 9. Set up Ubuntu One

If you’ve not heard of Ubuntu One by now then you’re missing out! It’s a
free cloud-storage service available for everyone. You get** 5GB** of
space for free in-which to store files, photos, music and more.
There are apps for iOS, Android, Windows, [and OS
X](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/10/official-ubuntu-one-client-for-mac-enters-beta "Official Ubuntu One App for Mac Enters Beta"),
so no-matter what computer you’re on you can have your life in sync
*and* in reach wherever you are or whatever you’re doing.

[![Ubuntu One Share Links in
12.10](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-29-at-20.47.13.png "Ubuntu One Share Links in 12.10")](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-29-at-20.47.13.png)

To get started hit the ‘*Ubuntu One’* icon on the Launcher and follow
the prompts that appear.
If you already have an Ubuntu One account then hit the*‘Sign In’* button
to start syncing your files to your new desktop.

### 10. Spread The Word

This item on our to-do list is a little cheesy, but it’s an important
one: If you like what you see, and find Ubuntu 13.04 useful then put
sharing word of it on *your* to-do list.
Whether you just post about it on Twitter, Facebook or Google+, or
actively burn a LiveDVD for a family member to try out, you’ll be not
only helping others explore their options, but you’ll also be helping
Ubuntu.
Don’t forget to enjoy using it, too. Go Check your Facebook or Google+
profile; chat to your mates on Empathy; type up a letter in LibreOffice
or find some awesome cat videos in the Unity Video Lens.
