Ubuntu Dell Laptops in China
**Dell are to *more than double* the number of its Chinese retail stores
stocking Ubuntu-loaded laptops, Canonical has announced. **
Over 1,000 of Dell's consumer-facing outlets in China will begin selling
computers loaded with the Chinese-language edition of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
over the coming weeks – up from the 400 stores that currently do so.
While the expansion is a sure sign that Dell's Ubuntu devices are
meeting with some success in China – no doubt [buoyed by the government
endorsement of Ubuntu Kylin as the de-facto Chinese
OS](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/03/ubuntu-to-become-the-official-os-of-china "Ubuntu To Become The Official OS Of China") -
[industry analysts are forecasting a steeper drop in PC sales for the
country than
in](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100998887 "CNBC Report on IDC figures for PC Shipments in China")any
other market.
Growing demand for mobile computing devices like tablets is, analysts
say, to 'blame' for the down-turn.
In the medium term this trend could play to Ubuntu's advantage.
China is [now the biggest smartphone
market](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-08/30/china-smartphone-market "China Smartphone market is now the biggest say Wired")
in the world; *China Unicom* is a member of[ the *Carrier Advisory
Group* for Ubuntu
Touch](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/07/china-telcom-unicom-join-ubuntu-touch-group "China Unicom Signs Up to Ubuntu Touch Advisory Group");
and the Chinese government has expressed a growing unease about a
culture of[ Android
dependence](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/05/us-china-google-android-idUSBRE9240B220130305 "China worried about android dependence ").
But, short of any firm mobile commitments in China, Ubuntu will need to
pin its hope on maintaining comparatively strong sales in a market
otherwise careering downwards.
**Government endorsements, a burgeoning mobile app developer culture,
and retail presence in 1,000 stores should all go a long way to ensuring
that.**
