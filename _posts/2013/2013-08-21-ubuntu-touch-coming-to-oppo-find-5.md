**![Oppo-Find-5-Heading-To-US-Unlocked-For-499](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Oppo-Find-5-Heading-To-US-Unlocked-For-499-300x226.jpg)Work
is underway on bringing Ubuntu Touch to the Oppo Find 5 smartphone.**
The device is made by China-based electronics manufacturer [*Oppo
 Digital.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPPO_Digital "about oppo digital")
Like many 3rd party, community-contributed builds it will be not be
formally supported by Canonical.
With the [*Oppo Find
5*](http://europe.oppostyle.com/home/8-find-5-white.html#/capacity-16gb "About the Oppo Find 5")
sporting some impressive specs at an equally impressive price, the
device could find favour with Ubuntu enthusiasts burnt out on the
(seemingly inevitable) failure of the Edge campaign.

#### Specifications

Specifications wise the Oppo doesn't quite match the Edge – but at $533
(nearly $300 less than the Edge's original price), and the fact it's
already available to buy,  it'd be unfair to expect it to.
The device, available in 16GB and 32GB versions, comes with:

-   Snapdragon (A7) Quad-Core CPU @ 1.5GHz
-   [Adreno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno "Adreno") 320 GPU
-   5″ screen (1080×1920, 441 PPI)
-   2GB RAM

Features-wise the device boasts the usual set:

-   GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, DLNA
-   WiFi Display & WiFi Direct
-   Gyroscope & digital compass
-   Light, IR proximity, magnetic & gravity sensors

#### Ubuntu Touch Progress

The developer behind the port, [Oppo forum user
Eoghan](http://www.oppoforums.com/members/eoghan.10740/), has only just
started '…getting a device tree etc modified to work with ubuntu touch's
build environment'. As such there's little 'fancy pants' stuff to see
for now.
But, with Ubuntu Touch developers providing [a comprehensive set of
documentation on porting Ubuntu Touch to Android
devices](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Porting "Ubuntu touh porting docs"),
it shouldn't be too long before Eoghan is able to get the platform up
and running.
Here's hoping that Ubuntu Touch also finds (ho-ho) its way to
Oppo's [forthcoming R819
device](http://europe.oppostyle.com/home/17-r819.html "Oppo R819 Pre-Order").
It's slimmer, sleeker albeit less powerful than the Find 5.
