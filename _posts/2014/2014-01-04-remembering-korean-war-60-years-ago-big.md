This Friday, June 25th, it will have been sixty years since the
beginning of the Korean War in 1950. After decades of Japanese
occupation, Korea was divided in two by Allied Forces at the end of
World War II, with the south administered by the U.S. and the north by
Soviet Russia. Deep divisions built over several years, leading to
skirmishes and finally an invasion by North Korean troops on June 25th,
1950. The United Nations sent troops and support from 21 countries to
support South Korea, primarily from the United States and Britain. The
war lasted for three years, with large advances and retreats on both
sides, and many casualties. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and
soldiers were killed. The two Koreas are technically still at war since
hostilities ended in a ceasefire, not a peace treaty in 1953. Though it
is often referred to as "The Forgotten War", I hope this collection of
photographs helps us to remember the events of 1950-53, those involved,
and the legacy that still remains, sixty years later. ([48 photos

Division, Company, unknown, found midway between the forward observation
post and the actual front line on July 10, 1950. The cameraman's caption

then shot. Most of them were shot through the head with their hands tied
behind their backs. Along with them was a variety of Equipment burned
and destroyed. (AP Photo)

This U.S. Army photograph, once classified "top secret", is one of a
series depicting the summary execution of 1,800 South Korean political
prisoners by the South Korean military at Taejon, South Korea, over
three days in July 1950. Historians and survivors claim South Korean
troops executed many civilians behind frontlines as U.N. forces
retreated before the North Korean army in mid-1950, on suspicion that
they were communist sympathizers and might collaborate with the
advancing enemy. (AP Photo/National Archives, Major Abbott/U.S. Army)
