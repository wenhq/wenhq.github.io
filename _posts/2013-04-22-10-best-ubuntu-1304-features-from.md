--- [10 Best Ubuntu 13.04 Features – From Social Lens to Window
Snapping](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/d0od/~3/7wuyZX7TKkY/new-ubuntu-13-04-features):\
**Next week sees the release of Ubuntu 13.04 – the latest iteration of
the worlds most popular Linux distribution. **\
But what can you expect to find in it? Unlike the last few releases
Ubuntu 13.04 features few dramatic changes, instead bringing some much
need polish and performance-boosts.\
In the list below you’ll find our top 10 changes **new
to Ubuntu 13.04.**\

### 10. New Window Snap Animation

<div style="width: 748px;">

New Window Snap Caught in Action

</div>

**Window snapping**, popularised by the ‘Aero Snap’ feature of Windows
7, is a handy way to quickly display two applications side-by-side
without overlapping, or maximise a window without needing to click a
button.\
For 13.04 a bit of attention has been given to the animation shown on
screen to tell you that ‘you’re about to snap’. Developers [have changed
its appearance](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/new-icons-window-snap-animation-land-in-unity "New Icons, Window Snap Animation Land in Unity") from
that of a generic orange box spreading outwards to a semi-transparent
copy of the window about to be snapped.\
Rather than read about how it looks hit play on the video below to see
it in action…\

### 9. New Unity Preview Animations

<div style="width: 750px;">

Previews

</div>

Unity Previews, introduced last year in Ubuntu 12.10, are a great way to
see more information about a search result without needing to open it up
fully.\
For the latest release the **preview reveal animation has been
tweaked,** and applications icons at the edges of the preview “ghosted”
save for the one being previewed.\
As with the window snapping above, this one is easier to see in action:\

\

### 8. New Shutdown Dialogs

Logging out, shutting down, rebooting – tasks that none of us expect to
be particularly glamorous. But chances are you’ll find yourself doing it
a a bit more routinely in 13.04 for one reason: to see the new
**Unity-themed session dialogs** that have been added.\

<div style="width: 750px;">

Logout Now Looks Sleeker

</div>

### 7. Per-App Account Toggles

One of my favourite features of the Ubuntu desktop is the centralised
‘*Online Accounts*‘ dashboard. From here I can add my email, social
network, and photo sharing accounts so that other desktop applications
can access them without me needing to enter my details in each and every
one.\
13.04 improves the utility by adding **‘per-app’ toggles** for each
network.\
So, say you’re happy for Facebook to integrate with the new Unity Photos
Lens, but don’t want Empathy, Ubuntu’s default IM app to log into
Facebook Chat. Before you had to disable Facebook entirely. Now you can
simply pick and chose what apps can use what accounts and where.
Brilliant stuff.\

Online Accounts Now Has Per-App Toggles

</div>

### 6. New Sync Menu

Originally planned to arrive on the [desktop last
year](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/09/have-you-seen-ubuntus-new-sync-menu "Ubuntu’s New Sync Menu In Action")
is this – the new **Ubuntu One Sync Menu. **With a single click you can
see whether you’re online; share a file; or check the status of recently
uploaded files.\
It’s not as featured as featured as similar ‘tray applets’ for similar
services on other operating systems, but it does the job.\

### 5. Workspace Item

Ahh, the poor **Workspace Launcher Item**. It’s no longer shown on the
Unity launcher by default so you now need to manually go and add it
from* System Settings &gt; Appearance &gt; Behaviour*.\
But when you do you’re in for a treat: the icon now displays which
workspace you’re on.\

<div style="width: 363px;">

### 4. New Bluetooth Menu

Ubuntu’s **Bluetooth panel menu** has been jazzed up with new toggle for
turning on/off Bluetooth and visibility. Handy stuff.\

<div style="width: 528px;">

### 3. New Lenses

If you have social accounts set up in Online Accounts, or images
imported into Shotwell, then you’ll see a new lens in the Unity Dash: a
**photo lens**!\

<div style="width: 750px;">

[![photo-lens](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-lens.jpg){width="750"

The new Photo Lens in 13.04

</div>

Similarly, now [Gwibber has been
removed](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/gwibber-not-in-ubuntu-13-04-install-friends "Where’d Gwibber Go in Ubuntu 13.04? And What’s Friends?") from
Ubuntu (don’t panic, it’s likely just for this release) Tweeters,
Facebookers and LinkedInner’s can get their social news fix from
the **new Social Lens** in the Dash.\
To access it you will first need to enable a social network in Online
Accounts (see \#7 above).\

<div style="width: 750px;">

Unity Lens Friends

</div>

### 2. Window Switching Methods

Switching between open windows has never been easier in Ubuntu.
Alongside traditional methods, like *Alt+Tab,* come two new ways to
manage your workflow:\

-   **Application Quicklists now list open windows**
-   **Scroll over an application icon on the launcher to cycle through
    its open windows**

Quicklist Window Switching – New to Raring

</div>

### 1. Speed, baby, speed

Okay, okay – I know this entry is a bit of a cop out as it’s not
*technically* a feature. But Ubuntu’s Unity desktop has, since its
introduction – both fairly and unfairly – received flak for being slow
and resource hungry.\
That is not the case in Ubuntu 13.04 thanks to an *inspired* decision
last October to use a mobile device
as [reference](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/10/ubuntu-installer-for-nexus-7-tablet-made-available-for-devs "Ubuntu Nexus 7 Installer App Released to Devs") for
tuning the core of Ubuntu against. The result is a smooth, snappy, and
slick experience.\
And this core experience matters more to most.\
