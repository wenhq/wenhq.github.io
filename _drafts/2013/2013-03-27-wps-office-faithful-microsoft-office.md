**When is Microsoft Office not Microsoft Office? When it’s actually a
faithfully-crafted imitation, of course!**\
WPS Office, built by Chinese development group *Kingsoft*, claims to be
the leading free office suite in China. And with such a familiar looking
interface that’s not a difficult notion to swallow.\
Three applications make up the suite:\

-   **Writer** – Word processing application
-   **Presentation** – Slideshow presentation maker
-   **Spreadsheets** – Spreadsheet application

Each of the apps are incredibly familiar in look to their Microsoft
counterparts.\
Compared to other free offerings like LibreOffice, Google Docs, and
Lotus Symphony, WPS has a distinct advantage: a lower learning curve for
those already versed, trained, or used to the Windows apps.\
Trivial sounding, sure. But for many the notion of having relearn what
they already know fosters reluctance. WPS, with its marriage of free and
familiar, has a good punt at solving this.\

### Features

The Qt suite apes the interface of Microsoft’s ‘Ribbon’ interface, and
whilst I can’t tell you whether it’s 100% accurate in its replication (I
haven’t used Microsoft Office long enough to tell), it’s certainly
authentic looking.\
For non-Ribbon fans WPS Office comes with the option of enabling the
old, menu-based Office look\

“Classic Look” Enabled in WPS Office.

WPS Office also adds a few handy features of its own, including an
online pool of document templates and the ability to edit multiple
documents in tabs.\
Biggest drawbacks: the release is beta; it sucks at opening .ODT files.
Oh, and the entire interface is in Chinese by default (though
reader [Mohammed
Sayanvala](http://mosayanvala.wordpress.com/ "Mohammed Sayanvala") has a
fix for the latter on his blog).\

### Download WPS Office Beta for Ubuntu

The latest version of WPS Office, a beta, can be downloaded for Ubuntu
32bit by hitting the button below:\

Linux](http://wdl.cache.ijinshan.com/wps/download/Linux/unstable/wps-office_8.1.0.3724~b1p2_i386.deb "Download WPS Office for Linux")

Once the suite has fully downloaded double-click on the .Deb file to
install through the Ubuntu Software Center.\
After installation completes you’ll be able to launch each of the three
applications through the Unity Dash.\
On first run you’ll be prompted to sign up to.. Well, I don’t know
because my Chinese is non-existent. Suffice to say, you can slap any old
rubbish into the required fields and it’ll disappear.\
